### Coding Standards
* Please follow the [Ruby on Rails coding standards](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#follow-the-coding-conventions).

* Have a look at the Development section on the right side menu, there are quite a few pages with standards: developer guidelines, code conventions, rubocop, database migrations, etc.

* We tend to discuss practices in discourse and then move them to this wiki. Some topics are still not described on the wiki, for example, the service naming conventions agreed [here](https://community.openfoodnetwork.org/t/how-to-name-a-new-service-in-ofn/1530/7?u=luisramos0).
