# The Open Food Foundation <a id="OFWF">

The [Open Food Foundation](www.openfoodweb.org/foundation) has been established to develop, accumulate and protect open source knowledge, code, applications and platforms for fair and sustainable food systems. 

We are a non-profit organisation, created to separate the licensing and development of open source software (to support local food enterprises) from the enterprises themselves. This enables collaboration on systems that support many needs, and will hopefully help to reduce administrative and technical burden on individual enterprises. 

The Statement of Purposes from our Constitution is below.

PART 3 – STATEMENT OF PURPOSES
3.1 The purpose of the OFWF is to accumulate and protect a commons (“the open food web”) of open source knowledge, code, applications and platforms to support the proliferation of fair and sustainable food systems.  

3.2 It will provide an ecosystem for coordinated, collaborative innovation to accelerate development of these open platforms and applications.

3.3 It will provide organisational, legal, technical and financial support for “the open food web”, through but not limited to the following strategies:
