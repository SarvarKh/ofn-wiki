## Why <a id="Why"/>

Diverse and locally adapted food enterprises can improve access to healthy food, offer a better deal for farmers, engage and build community connections and strengthen local economies. It is in our common interests to develop effective tools and platforms that support and strengthen many more of these!

While food enterprises that prioritise fair, sustainable and healthy food are proliferating, many face significant barriers and transaction costs from administration and IT.

The Open Food Web Foundation arose because there is a large amount of ‘reinventing the wheel’ in food projects that are often on very tight budgets to start with. We think this can do done better if we do it together. This first supported project aims to develop a very flexible system that can be used, adapted and connected to many other systems.

## How - Principles <a id="How"/>

### Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) <a id="FOSS"/>

We are completely committed to open source software: if code is closed then we cannot learn and build on each others' ideas. Every local food coop, hub, CSA has a different context and needs, and they need to be able to freely adapt. No one has 'the answer' to how we are going to be able to re-localise food systems, support sustainable farmers, reduce greenhouse emissions AND provide good, affordable food to everyone - so we're hoping that those of us trying (all around the world) can build on each others' ideas, challenges and successes.

Free and open source means "free as in free speech not as in free beer" - there is no prohibition in charging money for the use of open source software. For this project, there is likely to be a membership requirement or charge for: advanced features, customisation or supported services to hosted or advanced uses of the platform. However, the code-base here will always be free in all senses of the word!
