You sure can!

### Developers 

If you're a developer github is currently the best place to start contributing. We are in the process of developing a more transparent 'roadmap' so you can see the bigger picture - will update information here when it's ready. 

You can also join the  discussion list at ofndev@googlegroups.com if you have questions, comments or want to get in contact outside github.

If you're not yet a rails developer but would like to learn we're very happy to work with beginners. Skud at [growstuff](http://wiki.growstuff.org/index.php/Main_Page) has put together some great resources to get you going [here](http://wiki.growstuff.org/index.php/Newbie_guide).

### Everyone Else

There's plenty to do - we've got some fantastic people who could always do with more support with: comms and marketing; fundraising; supply chain operations; testing etc. Contact hello @ openfoodnetwork.org if you're interested.
