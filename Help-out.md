You sure can!

### Developers 

If you're a developer, you can either start picking off issues or have a look at our [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/709913#) board if you want to join in the current development focus.

You can also join the openfoodweb-dev@googlegroups.com discussion list if you have questions, comments or want to get in contact outside github.

If you're not yet a rails developer, but would like to learn we're very happy to work with beginners. Skud at [growstuff](http://wiki.growstuff.org/index.php/Main_Page) has put together some great resources to get you going [here](http://wiki.growstuff.org/index.php/Newbie_guide).

### Everyone Else

There's plenty to do - we've got some fantastic people who could always do with more support with: comms and marketing; fundraising; supply chain operations; testing etc. Go to [OFW Foundation](http://openfoodweb.org/foundation/category/ofw-platform/) for the latest.
