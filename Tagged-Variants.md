## Data model

A variant can be tagged by an enterprise.


## Creating tagged variants

This is done through the bulk product edit interface.
Begin with the standard process to add a new variant.
The tagged enterprise is specified in the variant row in the producer column.
To differentiate between setting a producer or a tag, the tag field will have a "#" in front of it, and will have a coloured background in the same styling as tags elsewhere on the site.
