## Sender

Order Confirmation emails should be sent from the email address provided by the Hub / Enterprise User.

This email address is set in the Enterprise User profile page of the Hub through which the order is placed. 
When a new Enterprise User is set up, there should be some sort of validation to make sure the email is correct [enter twice? conf email?]

If a User has permission to manage other Enterprises, when they are setting up new Hubs they should be prompted (offered) existing email addresses (as it is quite likely that they would be managing multiple Hub outlets)
