When reporting a bug, you need to set up a severity level so that the issue can be prioritized in the backlog.

## Severity 1
**Description**: the bug is stopping the platform from working, and there is no workaround. Lots of users are impacted and the affected feature is one of the critical ones: checkout, payments, signup, login.

**Timeframe**: immediately

**Examples**:
- the application is inaccessible in a given instance
- checkout crashes, not possible to make an order

## Severity 2
**Description**: the bug is affecting any of the non-critical features described in [Severity 1] and there is no workaround. Most users are impacted.

**Timeframe**: as soon as possible

**Examples**:
- [the private shopfront is not working and the workaround is unusable](https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork/issues/1493)

## Severity 3
**Description**: the bug is stopping a critical or non-critical feature but there is a usable workaround. Some users are impacted.

**Timeframe**: when you can

**Examples**:
- [The date picker doesn't work but we can change it in the date text](https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork/issues/1924)

## Severity 4
**Description**: the bug is annoying, but doesn't prevent from using the platform. Not so many users are impacted.

**Timeframe**: maybe one day

**Examples**:

## Severity 5
**Description**: we can live with it... Few users are impacted.
