This page outlines some of the potential interfaces with other software packages and systems that could build functionality of what we're doing. 

We would like to be able to connect with other services for many of the following functions. As a general rule, we will prioritise links with other open source projects. Where these don't exist (or don't yet provide sufficient functionality), we will build relationships with other useful and well-used services.

An important means of interacting with other services would be [[our API|API Documentation]].

### Profiles, Social Networking & Relationships
*  Login and 'info sharing' services: Facebook, Twitter, Google, Persona?, OpenID
*  Food system mapping and directory sites: [Sustaination](www.sustaination.co); [Local Harvest](www.localharvest.org.au); [Dibble](www.dibble.com.au) etc NB. As far as we know, there is not yet a FOSS option for food business mapping â€“ let us know if there is . .

### Business Management
*  OpenERP*
*  Accounting Packages: Quickbooks; Xero; Saasu etc

### Food Enterprise Systems
*  Bello Box*, Bucky Box, Ooooby
*  Food Connect, CERES Fair Food
*  Food Hub Software: StroudCo; OpenFoodSource; Food Hub Pro etc?

### Food Cooperative Systems

These systems focus on supporting a food cooperative. This is similar to a [buying group](http://openfoodnetwork.org/platform/user-guide/advanced-features/buying-groups/) in Open Food Network.

* [Foodsoft](https://github.com/foodcoops/foodsoft), [Cagette](https://github.com/bablukid/cagette), [Aixada](https://github.com/jmueller17/Aixada) and [more](https://github.com/ouisharelabs/food-dashboard#open-source-software)
 
### Transport and Distribution
*  MeeMeep
