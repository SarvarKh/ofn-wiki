Given our the absolute distribution nature of the dev team we run a series of regular catch ups to discuss the approach we follow to do the Spree upgrade as well the details of its development. Below you will find the slides and notes of each of these meetings.

These catch-ups have been held regularly since May but not all were worth a write up, as they were mostly a sync between [@HugsDaniel](https://github.com/HugsDaniel) and [@sauloperez](https://github.com/sauloperez).
