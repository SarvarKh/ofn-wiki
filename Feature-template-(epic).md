When a icebox item (Discourse) has been prioritized and moved to product development backlog (Discourse), it then goes through a brainstorming session where feature candidates are listed and mapped on a value matrix. As a result, **a feature candidate is selected**.

When that is done, a PO will **create an epic in GitHub for that selected feature** and list it into the project ["Product Feature Backlog"](https://github.com/openfoodfoundation/openfoodnetwork/projects/19), first column ("Selected feature backlog").

This template describes what should be in this epic.

````
## What is the problem we are solving 
<!-- Describe the problem this feature is supposed to solve. Should be described in the icebox item (in Discourse). -->

## Success factors = expected outcome 
<!-- Describe what is the expected outcome: when the feature is released, what would it look like? What will make you say "the problem is solved"? Can be metrics like "Platform has less than 1% service interruption", or yes/no statements like "People can checkout on mobiles. -->

## Useful information for inception
<!-- List here any information that can be useful for the inception stage. -->

## Link to the "Product Development - Backlog" item in Discourse
<!-- Put the link here, and put this epic link in the Discourse item as well for cross-referencing. -->
