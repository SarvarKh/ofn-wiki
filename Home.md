Welcome to the Developer documentation for [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/)! Please read this for an overview of how the project works and dig into other pages on this wiki for more info.

If you want more generally to understand the OFN project, how the community works and the general processes we have implemented, please check the [OFN handbook](https://ofn-user-guide.gitbook.io/ofn-handbook/).

## Communication tools
