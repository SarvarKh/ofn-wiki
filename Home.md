The Open Food Web project is a community of people working together to build a free and open source platform that provides an open marketplace and supply network for local food, so that:
*  Eaters can “know their farmers” (where they are, how they farm, exactly what price they get) while still having wide choice and the ease and convenience of local pick-up and access.  
*  Farmers can set their own prices, tell their own stories and choose who they trade with.
*  Ethical and diverse food enterprises rebuild local economies by supporting these farmers and eaters to distribute food.
  
The system is premised on transparency of supply chain information - giving farmers and eaters real choices in food value chains.     

This is the first project of the not-for-profit Open Food Web Foundation, which has been set up to accumulate and protect a commons of open source knowledge, code, applications and platforms to support the proliferation of fair and sustainable food systems.
